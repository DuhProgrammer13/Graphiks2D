***Graphiks2D*** 
(Still very early in development)

Graphiks2D is aimed at making everything simplified. 

Currently features are on pause as I go back through my code and really do a cleanup of all old messy code. (If you have been coding a while, you know what I'm talking about)

Features for to look forward to in the near future

* JSON GUI builder support
